This repository contains ML models and artifacts and other necessary code required to deploy a Flask Webapp on Heroku. The projects featured on this ML Playground are on the [Computer Vision repository](https://github.com/Akorex/Computer-Vision) which contains the Jupyter notebooks used for training the models for the various tasks. The tasks are:
1. Bird Species Classification
2. Brain Tumors Classification
3. Cats & Dogs Classification.

You can play with the models on the deployed [heroku page](https://ml-model-playground.herokuapp.com/home). 

Technologies used for this include TensorFlow, Git LFS, Flask & Heroku.
